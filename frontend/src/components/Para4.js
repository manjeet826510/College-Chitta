                        <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">The Renaissance in Europe ushered in a new age of scientific and
                            intellectual inquiry and appreciation of ancient Greek and Roman civilizations. Around 1450, Johannes
                            Gutenberg developed a printing press, which allowed works of literature to spread more quickly. The
                            European Age of Empires saw European ideas of education in philosophy, religion, arts and sciences
                            spread out across the globe. Missionaries and scholars also brought back new ideas from other
                            civilizations – as with the Jesuit China missions who played a significant role in the transmission of
                            knowledge, science, and culture between China and Europe, translating works from Europe like Euclid's
                            Elements for Chinese scholars and the thoughts of Confucius for European audiences. The Enlightenment
                            saw the emergence of a more secular educational outlook in Europe. Much of modern traditional Western
                            and Eastern education is based on the Prussian education system.[17]</p>

                                In most countries today, full-time education, whether at school or otherwise, is compulsory for all
                                children up to a certain age. Due to this the proliferation of compulsory education, combined with
                                population growth, UNESCO has calculated that in the next 30 years more people will receive formal
                                education than in all of human history thus far.[18]</p>
