                        most influential ancient philosopher, whose educational outlook continues to influence the societies of
                        China and neighbours like Korea, Japan, and Vietnam. Confucius gathered disciples and searched in vain
                        for a ruler who would adopt his ideals for good governance, but his Analects were written down by
                        followers and have continued to influence education in East Asia into the modern era.[9]

                        and military training. The Aztecs also had a well-developed theory about education, which has an
                        equivalent word in Nahuatl called tlacahuapahualiztli.</p>
